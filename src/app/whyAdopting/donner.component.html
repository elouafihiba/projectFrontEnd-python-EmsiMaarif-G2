        <h1>All your foster questions answered</h1>
    
    
    
        <h2>What is pet foster care?</h2>
        <p>Pet foster care provides a safe, nurturing environment for a homeless pet
           until a permanent home is found. Many rescue groups don’t have shelter 
           facilities to house pets, but rely on a network of foster carers to care 
           for pets in their own homes. Some shelters and pounds also rely on foster 
           carers to provide care for sick, injured or very young pets until they are
            ready to be adopted.</p>
    

    
        <h2>Why is pet foster care so important?</h2>
        <p>Every foster carer is saving the life of a pet. 
           Rescue groups can only take on a pet if they know 
           they have a carer to foster it. Without a carer 
           available, a pet may face a very uncertain future in the pound.</p>
    
        
       <h2>What is the biggest reward from fostering a pet?</h2>
       <p>
        <li>You’re providing a safe and nurturing environment for a pet that’s in desperate 
            need of a second chance. Foster pets are healthy and treatable pets who just need a
             comfortable place to stay for a while, and to be shown a little love and kindness 
             to help them feel safe, or to recover from injury or illness.
        </li> 
        <li> You’re creating a happy, adoptable pet that’s able to adapt easily to life in a 
            family home. Foster caring allows a much smoother transition when the pet is placed
             into his new home. As you can imagine, being kept in a pound or shelter can be very
              stressful and traumatic for many animals. In your home, they can feel safe and secure.
               They can be nurtured, exercised and socialised - all of which will help them adapt 
               more easily to family life when they do find their forever home.</li>
        <li>
            You’re helping to ease the strain on local rescue shelters. Every week, hundreds 
        of companion animals end up in shelters and pounds through no fault of their own. 
        Many shelters and rescue groups rely on networks of compassionate foster carers to
         provide a temporary home for pets that they would not otherwise be able to save, 
         due to limited space. In fact, more than 70% of the pets listed on PetRescue are
          in pet foster care and the more foster carers our rescue groups and shelters can
           reach out to, the more lives they can save in your local community.
        </li>
        <li>
            You can 'try before you buy'. Fostering is a great opportunity for you to see 
        if a particular pet or type of pet (small dog, large dog, cat, rabbit or other pet)
         is the right fit for your family and lifestyle.
        </li>

         <li>
            It makes you the most awesome parent. When you foster a pet, you’re teaching your
         kids a valuable lesson in being compassionate, caring and giving others a second chance.
         </li>

        <li> You can share your life with every kind of pet. You and your family can experience
         the joy of sharing your life and home with many different types and sizes of pets, 
         big dogs, little dogs, cats, rabbits, birds and more.</li>
           
        <li> You’ll make more friends. As well as making a new furry friend every time you foster,
         if you foster a dog you’ll find lots of people want to come over and say hi to you and
          your foster friend. It’s a great way to get to know more people in your local community.</li>
          
        <li>It’s a more flexible way of having a pet in your life. You can choose to foster at a
         time that’s convenient for you and your lifestyle. Perhaps, you’re not ready to commit
          to owning a pet, but you can commit to looking after a pet for a few months. Although,
           it’s important to note that the time you have your foster pet can vary from just a 
           week to several months, depending on how long it takes to find the perfect forever home.
        </p>

       <h2>Who typically becomes a pet foster carer?</h2>
       <p>
        People from all walks of life become foster carers. Students who can’t commit to a lifelong
         pet; retirees who love pets but want to travel; families who want to make a difference; 
         people without a pet of their own or people who can welcome an additional pet into their lives.
          The only typical thing about foster carers is their love of pets.
       </p>

       <h2>How much time do I need to put into it?</h2>
       <p>
        It completely depends on the pet. If you decide to become a foster carer for unweaned puppies,
         you won’t be getting much sleep for a few weeks! But if you are looking to help a settled older 
         dog or cat, then you’ll just be providing the normal amount of cuddles and walks a pet needs.
       </p>
        
       <h2>Are there any financial obligations?</h2>
       <p>
        All rescue groups operate slightly differently, depending on their size, location and type of 
        pet they rehome. Generally, the group will cover all vet costs and the foster carer provides food.
       </p>
       <h2>Are there any other resources I might need to commit?</h2>
       <p>
        Love and compassion are the main requirements of a foster carer. The rescue group will give you 
        all the basic info you need to care for your foster pet, and will let you know upfront if you need
         to provide anything else.
       </p>

       <h2>Would I require any permits? </h2>
       <p>
        Not usually, but every state and council area is different. The rescue group will make sure you are 
        in compliance with any requirement.
       </p>

       <h2>How long would I need to keep a fostered pet for?</h2>
       <p>
        Each pet is different. If you’re fostering a small-breed puppy, they are unlikely to be with you more
         than a few weeks. But if big boofy dogs are your thing, they may be with you for a few months. The 
         rescue group will give you an idea on how long they would expect each pet to be in your care. If your
          circumstances change (you need to go away or something urgent comes up) the rescue group will find a
           new foster carer for the pet.
       </p>


       <h2>What happens if I want to keep a foster pet? </h2>
       <p>
        Of course, if you fall in love and want to keep your foster pet, you can make it official and adopt your
         foster pet. And, hopefully, you’ll keep fostering other pets too.
       </p>
       
       <h2>What happens if I don’t like a foster pet?   </h2>
       <p>
        If for any reason, your foster pet isn’t a good match for your family, your rescue group will find a new 
        carer.
       </p>

       <h2>What kind of pets are normally fostered out?   </h2>
       <p>
        Dogs, cats, puppies, kittens, rabbits, guinea pigs and horses. Foster caring helps every type of pet.
       </p>

       <h2>Can I choose a particular animal, breed or size?  </h2>
       <p>
        Yes, the rescue group will work with you to find the most suitable foster pet for your circumstances.
       </p>

       <h2>On average, how many pets will a carer foster?  </h2>
       <p>
        Usually, one at a time, unless they are fostering a bonded pair or litters, or have resources for more. 
        Some foster carers choose to foster while they can’t make a lifetime commitment.
       </p>
